              <p>Hussein is a top tier hacker and one of the best Bug Bounty hunters Iv'e worked with, getting him to spill some of his magic spells and real world examples is a gem that I wouldn't skip on. Iv'e collaborated with Hussein to eventually win Okta's Bug Bash 2021 Live Hacking Event, and even as a Bug Bounty Hunter who found more than 1000 bugs I'm taking the course and will be happy to learn new stuff.
